# Nonlinear-fitness-with-TRM
We show how transient responses to pulse disturbances accumulate to determine a press disturbances. For stage-structured models, this cumulative change is given by a new Transient Response Matrix (TRM) that can be readily computed. TRM also yields the second derivatives of population growth rate with respect to matrix elements
